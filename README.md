## About

- InstaPaws is a community-driven web application designed for dog lovers to share their furry friends with the world. Similar to Instagram, InstaPaws allows users to post photos and engage with others through likes, comments, and followsâ€”all centered around their beloved dogs.

- Whether you're showcasing your dog's latest adventure, connecting with fellow pet owners, or simply enjoying wholesome dog-related content, InstaPaws provides a welcoming platform for the dog-loving community to come together.

## Project Goals

- The goal of this project was to create a unique and engaging platform centered around dogs, putting a fun twist on a typical social media app. With InstaPaws, I wanted to combine interactive features, vibrant design elements, and a community-driven concept to create a space where dog lovers can connect, share, and celebrate their furry friends. My aim was to make the app feel welcoming, enjoyable, and refreshing for users, fostering a sense of belonging and joy within the dog-loving community.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

- For the design of InstaPaws, I aimed to follow a cohesive and visually appealing color palette to create a vibrant and engaging user experience. The primary colors were selected to reflect the playful and community-driven theme of the app.

- While I adhered to this color palette as closely as possible, there were instances where adjustments were necessary. In particular, some colors had to be darkened to ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility. This was done to meet accessibility standards and improve the Lighthouse score, ensuring the platform is user-friendly for everyone.

- By prioritizing accessibility, I balanced aesthetics with functionality, creating a design that is both visually appealing and inclusive.

### Animations

When building this website, I wanted to keep the experience engaging and fun, so I added unique animations to enhance user interaction. Here are the animations implemented:
- Navbar Fade-In: When loading the page, the navbar smoothly fades in from top to bottom, adding a playful touch for the user.
- Icon Animations: Hovering over navbar icons triggers a shake animation, while smaller icons have a gentle shake, creating an interactive and intuitive navigation experience.
- Profile Picture Animation: Hovering over profile pictures applies a gentle shake effect, providing a clear visual cue to the user.
- "Most Followed" Section Tilt: A slight tilt animation is applied to the "Most Followed" section, highlighting its significance and drawing user attention.
- "Search by Post Tags" Bounce: Tags in the "Search by Post Tags" section have a subtle bounce-right animation to encourage users to explore tag-based search functionality.
- Scroll-to-Top Button: The scroll-to-top button bounces gently up and down, providing a visual cue for navigation. It fades in only after the user scrolls down the page.
- Follow/Unfollow Button Bounce: On the profile page, the "Follow" and "Unfollow" buttons have a slight bounce animation, indicating their functionality to the user.
- Button Hover Effects: Buttons across the website feature a gentle shake animation when hovered over, enhancing interactivity and making the user experience more engaging.

### Wireframes

- I used [Wireframes.cc ](https://wireframe.cc/) as my preferred wireframing tool for designing the website due to its simplicity and user-friendly interface. While the final design of the website may differ slightly from the wireframes, they served as foundational guidelines to visualize the structure and layout I aimed to achieve. Wireframes were created for both mobile and desktop views to ensure a responsive and consistent user experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- React 18.3.1
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### Libraries, frameworks and dependencies

- **Axios:** This was used for promise-based HTTP requests.  
  **Justification:** I utilized Axios in the front end to send various types of requests to my API for sending and retrieving data for users to view. It also helped prevent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors by enabling controlled access to data on my API's domain.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT) Library:** This library was used for decoding JSON Web Tokens.  
  **Justification:** I implemented JWT to prevent unauthenticated users from making unnecessary network requests to refresh their access token. This enabled me to set and remove authentication tokens, ensuring the site recognized a user's login status. If logged out, no authentication token was stored in cookies.

- **React:** This is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
  **Justification:** React allowed me to create multiple encapsulated components that manage their own state. It was particularly beneficial for automatically updating the user interface when data changed.

- **React Bootstrap:** This library was used to import various pre-designed components that are mobile-responsive and come with preset classes and styles.  
  **Justification:** It significantly accelerated the development process by allowing me to focus on functionality rather than spending excessive time on HTML styling.

- **React Router:** This library was used for dynamic routing.  
  **Justification:** It allowed me to control the content displayed based on the URL being accessed by the user. This was essential for building all the pages of my site and defining functional route paths.

- **React Transition Group:** This library was used to implement CSS transitions.  
  **Justification:** It enabled smooth fade-in effects for components on my website, contributing to the visually engaging and dynamic look I aimed for.

- **React Infinite Scroll:** This library played a crucial role in keeping users engaged.  
  **Justification:** It allowed content (posts and comments) to load automatically as users scrolled toward the bottom of the page, ensuring that content was continuously available without disrupting the user experience.

## Front-End

### React

React is a widely-used JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces. Created by Facebook, React enables developers to construct reusable UI components and manage their state, simplifying the creation of complex, dynamic, and interactive web applications. Reactâ€™s virtual DOM ensures efficient updates and rendering of components, leading to fast and responsive applications. With its large, active community, extensive ecosystem of tools and libraries, and emphasis on declarative, component-based programming, React has become a top choice for modern web application development.

#### Why I Used React in My Project

1. **Reusability:** Reactâ€™s component-based structure facilitates the reuse of code, streamlining the development process and saving time.

2. **Performance:** The virtual DOM allows React to efficiently update and render components, ensuring a high-performance user experience.

3. **Community Support:** Reactâ€™s large and active community provides access to numerous tools, libraries, and solutions, keeping development current and efficient.

4. **Declarative Programming:** Reactâ€™s declarative approach simplifies code comprehension and debugging, reducing the risk of bugs.

5. **Scalability:** Reactâ€™s architecture scales well for projects of all sizes, from small applications to large, complex systems.

This project leveraged Reactâ€™s strengths, particularly the ability to render multiple components simultaneously across the application.

#### Components Created for My Application

To meet the project requirements, I developed several reusable and unique React components:

- **`<Asset />`**  
  This component dynamically displayed assets based on the props provided. Props included:  
  - A loading spinner icon from `react-spinners` for when content was loading.  
  - An image with a `src` attribute.  
  - A message rendered within a paragraph tag.

- **`<Avatar />`**  
  A reusable component for rendering user profile pictures (avatars). It accepted a `src` prop, allowing the avatar image to be updated (e.g., when a user changed their profile picture). This component was used in multiple pages, such as posts, the profile page, and the `<NavBar />` component.

- **`<DropdownMenu />`**  
  This component rendered dropdown menus for editing or deleting user content. It was implemented across multiple pages, including the post page (for editing user posts), profile page (for editing profile data), and comments sections.

- **`<NavBar />`**  
  A reusable component displayed on every page of the application. The content within the navbar adjusted based on the userâ€™s authentication status. For example:  
  - If a user was not logged in, it displayed icons for login/signup.  
  - If logged in, it showed the avatar component and a dropdown menu for logging out or accessing the userâ€™s profile.

- **`<HomePage />`**  
  A unique component that rendered the homepage for unauthenticated users. It displayed login/signup buttons to encourage user engagement.

- **`<PageNotFound />`**  
  A unique component that rendered a "Page Not Found" message and image for 404 errors. It also included a "Go Back" button, which used `history.goBack()` to navigate the user back to their previous page.

- **`<ScrollToTopButton />`**  
  A reusable component that displayed a "scroll to top" button at the bottom-right of the screen when the user scrolled beyond a certain point. This enhanced usability by allowing users to quickly return to the top of the page to access the search functionality or tag filters.

- **`<Toolbar />`**  
  A reusable component displaying icons for creating posts, viewing liked posts, and accessing the userâ€™s feed (posts from followed users). This component was prominently used throughout the application.

Each of these components was carefully designed to maximize reusability and contribute to a seamless user experience.

## Back-End API
