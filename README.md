## About

- InstaPaws is a community-driven web application designed for dog lovers to share their furry friends with the world. Similar to Instagram, InstaPaws allows users to post photos and engage with others through likes, comments, and followsâ€”all centered around their beloved dogs.

- Whether you're showcasing your dog's latest adventure, connecting with fellow pet owners, or simply enjoying wholesome dog-related content, InstaPaws provides a welcoming platform for the dog-loving community to come together.

## Project Goals

- The goal of this project was to create a unique and engaging platform centered around dogs, putting a fun twist on a typical social media app. With InstaPaws, I wanted to combine interactive features, vibrant design elements, and a community-driven concept to create a space where dog lovers can connect, share, and celebrate their furry friends. My aim was to make the app feel welcoming, enjoyable, and refreshing for users, fostering a sense of belonging and joy within the dog-loving community.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

- For the design of InstaPaws, I aimed to follow a cohesive and visually appealing color palette to create a vibrant and engaging user experience. The primary colors were selected to reflect the playful and community-driven theme of the app.

- While I adhered to this color palette as closely as possible, there were instances where adjustments were necessary. In particular, some colors had to be darkened to ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility. This was done to meet accessibility standards and improve the Lighthouse score, ensuring the platform is user-friendly for everyone.

- By prioritizing accessibility, I balanced aesthetics with functionality, creating a design that is both visually appealing and inclusive.

### Animations

When building this website, I wanted to keep the experience engaging and fun, so I added unique animations to enhance user interaction. Here are the animations implemented:
- Navbar Fade-In: When loading the page, the navbar smoothly fades in from top to bottom, adding a playful touch for the user.
- Icon Animations: Hovering over navbar icons triggers a shake animation, while smaller icons have a gentle shake, creating an interactive and intuitive navigation experience.
- Profile Picture Animation: Hovering over profile pictures applies a gentle shake effect, providing a clear visual cue to the user.
- "Most Followed" Section Tilt: A slight tilt animation is applied to the "Most Followed" section, highlighting its significance and drawing user attention.
- "Search by Post Tags" Bounce: Tags in the "Search by Post Tags" section have a subtle bounce-right animation to encourage users to explore tag-based search functionality.
- Scroll-to-Top Button: The scroll-to-top button bounces gently up and down, providing a visual cue for navigation. It fades in only after the user scrolls down the page.
- Follow/Unfollow Button Bounce: On the profile page, the "Follow" and "Unfollow" buttons have a slight bounce animation, indicating their functionality to the user.
- Button Hover Effects: Buttons across the website feature a gentle shake animation when hovered over, enhancing interactivity and making the user experience more engaging.

### Wireframes

- I used [Wireframes.cc ](https://wireframe.cc/) as my preferred wireframing tool for designing the website due to its simplicity and user-friendly interface. While the final design of the website may differ slightly from the wireframes, they served as foundational guidelines to visualize the structure and layout I aimed to achieve. Wireframes were created for both mobile and desktop views to ensure a responsive and consistent user experience across devices.
